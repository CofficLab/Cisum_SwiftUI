## About

[Product Introduction](https://coffic.zone.id/en/cisum)

[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/cisum/id6466401036)

## Motivation

Are you tired of being bothered by:

- Splash screen ads
- Shake-to-navigate features
- Endless pop-up windows
- 10-second launch times
- Overwhelming features

We decided to make our own app to keep software simple and pure.
